## Notebooks

To run these notebooks, you need to compute the zero-cost metrics for each dataset.    
Alternatively, you can download precomputed results from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fUBaTd05OHrKIRs-x9Fx8Zsk5QqErks8?usp=sharing) and save to the root folder of this repo.    
You will also need the [`data` directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Eia6YuTE5tn5Lis_43h30HYpnF9Ynqf?usp=sharing), which should also be saved to the root folder of the repo.
